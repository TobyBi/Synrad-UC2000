# Synrad UC2000 Controller

Wrapper to communicate with a Synrad [UC-2000 Universal Laser Controller](https://synrad.com/en/products/accessories/uc-2000) through the REMOTE port. A UC-2000 controller controls Synrad [48 Series CO~2~ lasers](https://synrad.com/en/products/lasers/48-series).

## Requirements
Requires at least Python 3.8.5 but no external libraries are required.

Only written and tested with LabJack DAQ control and 48-2 and 48-5 lasers in mind.
